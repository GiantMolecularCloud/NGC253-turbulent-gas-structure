## Abstract

We compare molecular gas properties in the starbursting center of NGC 253 and the Milky Way Galactic center (GC) on scales of ∼1-100 pc using dendrograms and resolution-, area-, and noise-matched data sets in CO (1-0) and CO (3-2). We find that the size-line width relations in NGC 253 and the GC have similar slope, but NGC 253 has larger line widths by factors of ∼2-3. The σ^2/R dependency on column density shows that, in the GC, on scales of 10-100 pc the kinematics of gas over N > 3×10^21 cm-2 are compatible with gravitationally bound structures. In NGC 253 this is only the case for column densities N > 3×10^22 cm-2. The increased line widths in NGC 253 originate in the lower column density gas. This high velocity dispersion, not gravitationally self-bound gas, is likely in transient structures created by the combination of high average densities and feedback in the starburst. The high densities turn the gas molecular throughout the volume of the starburst, and the injection of energy and momentum by feedback significantly increases the velocity dispersion at a given spatial scale over what is observed in the GC.


## Disclaimer

Note that is this should not be understood as a pipeline to automatically reproduce the results of this publication.
Changes during the analysis and interactive steps may prevent these scripts from running unsupervised.
Instead, they should allow to understand technical aspects of the analysis and retrace it, e.g. to test consistency with future analyses.
Scripts may make intransparent use of convenience functions, such as my [python_helpers](https://github.com/GiantMolecularCloud/python_helpers).
These may be loaded in a python startup file which is not apparent from the scripts.
Also, software versions may not be given. For example, some code may break when run in python3 because it was developed in python2 back then. This applies equivalently for other software packages.
Personal information such as file paths are edited out which may break cross-references between scripts.
Note that many python scripts are actually CASA scripts and require certain packages such as astropy to be installed within CASA.
